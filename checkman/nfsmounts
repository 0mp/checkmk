title: Check health of NFS mounts

description:
 This check probes the availability of NFS mounts. The
 Linux agent sends the status of all NFS mounts, if the
 command line utility {maxwait} is available (it is
 is used to avoid hanging if the NFS server is not
 responding). The probe is done by trying a {stat -f} 
 (system call {statfs(2)}) on the mount point. If that
 lasts longer then 2 seconds, then the server is considered
 to be not responding.

 When you install the Linux agent manually, please
 do not forget to also install {waitmax} into {/usr/bin}.
 That file is shipped together with the agent. When
 {waitmax} is missing, the agent will silently omit
 the section {nfsmounts}.

 If the NFS mount is "stale", then {stat -f} returns immediately 
 but with a size of {-1}. The check detects that and results
 in a warning state.

item:
 The mount point.

perfdata:
  This check does not provide performance data. The disk
  usage is assumedly measured on the file server itself.
  Duplicating that data on all clients would unneccessarily
  create redundant RRDs.

inventory:
  All NFS mounts are found automatically. This is not
  by scanning {/proc/mounts}. The file {/etc/fstab} 
  is irrelevant.
