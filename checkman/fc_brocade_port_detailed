description:
 This checks monitors the used ports of a Brocade FibreChannel switch.
 The logical and physical state of each port is checked as well
 as various error counters (currently those are CRC errors, ENC out
 and C3 discards).

item:
 The port number as two-digit string as printed on the switch
 and as used in the management softare of the switch. The first
 port has the item {"01"}.

examples:
 # set levels for errors, not for in/out
 fc_brocade_port_detailed_default_levels = (
    ( 1, 500    ),     # warn at 1, crit at 500 CRC errors per check intervall
    ( 0.1, 10.0 ),     # warn/crit if encout is more then 0.1 or 10% of packets
    ( 101.0, 101.0 ) ) # do never alert C3 discards

 # Same, but warning if traffic more than 160MB/s on in or out,
 # no level for critical and assumed link baudrate of 2GBit/s
 fc_brocade_port_detailed_default_levels = (
    (1, 500), (0.1, 10.0), (101.0, 101.0), (2, 160, None))

perfdata: 
 Five variables: the number of bytes received and transmitted, and the number
 of CRC error, ENC out and C3 discards.

inventory:
 All ports are monitored, except unsed and missing ones (those without
 a transmission module installed).

[parameters]
crcerrors (number, number): A pair of levels for the CRC errors. If the level is
 an integer number, it is considered to be an absolute number
 to be applied to the number of
 events in once check cycle. If it is a floating point
 number it is interpreted as the percentage of errors in relation
 to the total number of packets received in the last check cycle.
encout (number, number):    A pair of levels for the ENC out counter. 
c3discards (number, number): A pair of levels for the C3 discards.
inoutlevels (number, number, number): An optional triple used for 
 checking in- and outgoing traffic. The first argument is the assumed link speed
 in GBit/sec. For inter switch links (ISL) the brocade MIB contains an
 entry for the current speed - which is being used. If that is different
 from the assumed link speed, then the levels are adapted accordingly.
 If you set the assumed link speed to 2, the level to 160 and the detected
 link speed is 4GBit/s, then the level is being raised to 320. The other
 two arguments are the levels for warning and critical in MB/s. Each of those may
 be set to {None} in order to disable that level.

[configuration]
fc_brocade_port_detailed_default_levels ( pair, pair, pair, triple ):
    Default levels used by inventorized checks. This is preset to {( (1, 0.1), (1, 0.1), (1, 0.1), (2, 160, None) )}.
