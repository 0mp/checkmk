description:
 This checks monitors the used ports of a Brocade FibreChannel switch.
 The logical and physical state of each port is checked as well
 as various error counters (currently those are CRC errors, ENC out
 and C3 discards).

item:
 The port number as two-digit string as printed on the switch
 and as used in the management softare of the switch. The first
 port has the item {"01"}.

examples:
 fc_brocade_port_detailed_default_levels = (
    ( 1, 500    ),     # warn at 1, crit at 500 CRC errors per check intervall
    ( 0.1, 10.0 ),     # warn/crit if encout is more then 0.1 or 10% of packets
    ( 101.0, 101.0 ) ) # do never alert C3 discards

perfdata: 
 Five variables: the number of bytes received and trasmitted, and the number
 of CRC error, ENC out and C3 discards.

inventory:
 All ports are monitored, except unsed and missing ones (those without
 a transmission module installed).

[parameters]
crcerrors (number, number): A pair of levels for the CRC errors. If the level is
 an integer number, it is considered to be an absolute number
 to be applied to the number of
 events in once check cycle. If it is a floating point
 number it is interpreted as the percentage of errors in relation
 to the total number of packets received in the last check cycle.
encout (number, number):    A pair of levels for the ENC out counter. 
c3discards (number, number): A pair of levels for the C3 discards.

[configuration]
fc_brocade_port_detailed_default_levels ( pair, pair, pair ):
    Default levels used by inventorized checks. This is preset to {( (1, 0.1), (1, 0.1), (1, 0.1) )}.
