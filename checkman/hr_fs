title: Used space in filesystems via SNMP
agents: snmp
catalog: os/storage
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the usage of filesystems using SNMP and
 the {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB}, which is supported by many SNMP
 agents - especially those on full operating systems.

 For configuration parameters and examples please refer to the man page
 of {df}.

 Please note, that due to the fact that Linux usually reserves 5% of
 the filesystem for root, the amount of used space output by this
 check and the native {df} check of Linux differs by up to 5%. The
 {df} check accounts the reserved space as used, as this is a safer
 assumption. Whereas the SNMP agent accounts it as free. There is no
 way to get the information about the reserved space via SNMP, so
 there is no way to fix this, unfortunately.

item:
 The description of the filesystem as in {hrStorageDescr}. For
 Linux SNMP agents this is the mount point.

inventory:
 For each fixed disk one service is generated - if the description
 of the filesystem in not listed in {inventory_df_exclude_mountpoints}.

perfdata:
 One or three values: The first value is the used space of the filesystem
 in MB. Also the minimum (0 MB), maximum (size of the filesystem) and the warning and critical
 levels in MB are provided. If {trend_range} is set (the default), then
 two additional values are output: the change of the usage in MB per range
 since the last check (e.g. in MB per 24 hours) and the averaged change (so called trend),
 also in MB per range.
