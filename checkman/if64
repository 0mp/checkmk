description:
 This check does exactly the same as {if} but uses 64 bit counters from
 the {IF-MIB} below {.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1}. This allow to correctly
 monitor switch ports with a traffic of more then 2GB per check interval.

 Also this check uses {ifAlias} instead if {ifDescr} for retrieving
 the admin-configured interface description. This is useful for HP ProCurve
 switches which do not show that aliasses in {ifDescr}.

 You might need to configure your switches as {bulkwalk_hosts} in order
 to have access to the needed mibs (e.g. for HP ProCurve).

 Please see the manual of {if} for details on configuration, inventory
 and performance values.
