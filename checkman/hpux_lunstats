description:

 This check measures the throughput LUNs on HP-UX. This check
 is fully compatible with {diskstat} and uses the same
 parameters and configuration variables.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls LUNs or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"sda"}. In order to support configurations
 up to version 1.1.10 also the items {"read"} and {"write"} are supported.

examples:
 # switch inventory behaviour to 1.1.10 mode
 diskstat_inventory_mode = "legacy"

 # alternative: create one check for all disks
 diskstat_inventory_mode = "summary"

 # Set default levels for diskstat
 diskstat_default_levels = {
   "read" :    (10, 20),   # level for read MB/sec
   "write" :   (20, 40),   # level for write MB/sec
   "average" : 15,         # averaging in minutes
 }

 # Alternative: just enable averaging over 10 minutes,
 # do not apply levels:
 diskstat_default_levels = {
     "average" : 15
 }

 # Settings for certain hosts:
 check_parameters += [
   ( {"write" : (20, 50), "average" : 10 }, [ "oracle" ], ALL_HOSTS, [ "Disk IO" ])
 ]

inventory:
  The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}. If this is set
  to {"single"} (the default), then one check will be created for each
  disk. If it is set to {"summary"} then only one service per host will be
  created that has at least one hard disk. If set to {"legacy"} then a
  separate check for read and write will be created (deprecated).
