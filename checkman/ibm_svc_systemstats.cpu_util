description:
 Reports the CPU Utilization of an IBM SVC / V7000 device in total.

 The check returns {WARN} or {CRIT} if the utilization in percent is higher
 then given levels and {OK} otherwise.

 data from the device. Your monitoring user must be able to SSH to the device
 with SSH Key Authentification. Please exchange SSH key. The Special Agent itself

inventory:
 Creates one check IBM SVC / V7000 device.

perfdata:
 One value: The utilization in percent, together with it's levels for
 warn and crit.

examples:
 # set default levels to 70 and 80 percent:
 ibm_svc_cpu_default_levels = (70.0, 80.0)

 # Check CPU Utilization on a IBM SVC called my-svc with default levels
 checks += [
   ("my-svc", "ibm_svc_nodestats.cpu_util", None, ibm_svc_cpu_default_levels)
 ]

 # or use individual levels for warn and crit
 checks += [
   ("my-svc", "ibm_svc_nodestats.cpu_util", None, (75.0, 85.0))
 ]
