description: 
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) for the
 status of any load balancing pools. It gathers the number of loadbalancers backing the pool
 and how many of those are working. It doesn't currently honor the 'MinUpMembers' parameter
 that can be set to trigger actions for the pool if too many members fail.

 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's tested against 9.3
 devices.

inventory:
 The check gather a list of the pools defined on a system. It will include non-enabled ones,
 as this is considered a temporary state.

perfdata: 
 the check does not (yet) generate performance data.
