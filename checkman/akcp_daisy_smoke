description:
 This check monitors the state of smoke sensors on all expansion boards which are daisy chained to an AKCP securityProbe 5E.
 If the sensors's state is 'normal' the check results in OK. The sensor states 'no status', 'relay on' or 'relay off' lead
 to an UNKN result. When the sensor state is one of 'high critical', 'low critical' or 'sensor error' the check results in CRIT.

inventory:
 All smoke sensors are automatically detected. Each one is defined by its description.
