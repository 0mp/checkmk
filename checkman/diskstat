description:
 This check measures the cumulative throughput of 
 all block (disk) devices of a Linux host. In the current
 version this check is always OK. There is now way
 to define levels. This might come in a future release,
 but is not trivial: A sensible level would have to
 be matched against an average throughput over a
 longer period of time, not just over one check cycle.

item:
 Either {"read"}- for input - or {"write"}- for output.

examples:
  checks = [
    ("zbghora12", "diskstat", "read",  None),
    ("zbghora12", "diskstat", "write", None),
  ]

perfdata:
  One variable: the throughput since the last check
  in in bytes(!) per second. 

inventory:
  The inventory will automatically find two services:
  one for {read} and one for {write}.
