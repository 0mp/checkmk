 check.

examples:
 # Trigger warning/critical level if power drops below 100 or 20 Watt
 ge_power_default_levels = (100, 20)

perfdata: 
 The current output power int Watt

inventory:
 Supported. 

[parameters]
warn (int): The warning level: the power should not drop at or below this level
crit (int): The critical level: the power must not drop at or below this level

[configuration]
