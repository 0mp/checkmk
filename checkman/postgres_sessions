description:
  This check allows tracking of the session parameters for a PostgreSQL 
  database.
  It reports how many sessions there are in total and how many of them are
  actively querying something.

  It allows to set {WARN} and {CRIT} tresholds on any of these parameters.

inventory:
  The check generates one item for the sessions connected to the PostgreSQL
  daemon.


[configuration]
  There is no preset level for this service, as the thresholds are dependant
  on the application and usage of the PostgreSQL databases.


perfdata:
  The check generates perfdata for the total and running sessions.
