description:
 The MRPE is a simple and efficient way to use standard Nagios
 Plugins with the {check_mk_agent} and thus emulate NRPE to
 a certain degree. Its main usage is to allow a soft migration
 from NRPE to check_mk and to use third party Nagios plugins
 that are running locally on your target hosts.

 This check type processes the MRPE section in the output of the
 agent. Since
 all levels and parameters are configured on the target host,
 no parameters are needed here. Please refer to the online
 documentation on how to configure the agent.

item:
 The service description of the check as configured in {mrpe.cfg}
 on the target host.

perfdata:
 All performance data is transparently
 transported via check_mk to Nagios. If you are using PNP4Nagios, you
 can set {perfdata_format = "pnp"} in your {main.mk}. This will let
 PNP4Nagios choose a template matching the original check command.

inventory:
 All plugins configured in {mrpe.cfg} are automatically inventorized.

[configuration]
perfdata_format (string): Set to {"pnp"} for adding the check command
 for PNP4Nagios
