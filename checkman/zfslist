description:
 This check monitors the usage of ZFS filesystems using the output
 of the command {zfslist}. This is done in a separate check since
 the output of {df} does not show the required metrics when ZFS
 is used with quotas.

 The check is fully compatible with {df} with respect to its configuration,
 output and logic. Please refer to the manual of {df} for details.
