description:
 This check makes use of the output of a working {ipmitool} on
 a Linux system. If the kernel properly supports IPMI and {ipmitool}
 is installed, then the agent will output the current state of
 power supplies, cooling devices and temperatures. This check makes
 sure that all those devices are working properly.

 Fortunately, IPMI provides not only the current sensor values
 but also their state, so no levels need to be configured for
 this checks.

 This check provides a summarized mode, where all sensors
 appear as one summary check per host and a detailed mode
 with one check per sensor.

item:
 {"Summary"} for summary mode, the name of the IPMI item
 in detailed mode.

inventory:
 In summary mode, one check is created if at least one
 sensor is found by the agent. In detailed mode one
 item is created for each sensor found. 
 
 Note: Some obscure hardware lists sensors in the state
 {nr} which do not produce usable output. If you set
 {impi_ignore_nr} to {True} then these sensors will
 be ignored.

perfdata:
 In summary mode only the current ambient temperature
 will be output - if available. In detailed mode each
 sensors outputs its current value.

examples:
 # Ignore sensors in state 'nr'
 ipmi_ignore_nr = True

 # Make inventory produce detailed IPMI checks
 ipmi_summarize = False

[configuration]
ipmi_ignore_nr (boolean): If set to {True}, sensors
 with the state {nr} will be ignored. Default is {False}.
ipmi_summarize (boolean): If set to {False}, the inventory
 will create a separate service for each IPMI device. Default
 is {True}.
