title: Check logfiles for relevant new messages
agents: linux, windows, aix, solaris

description:
 This check processes the output of those agents
 having the logwatch extension. The windows agent
 has this extension built in. The logwatch extension
 of the Linux/UNIX agents needs a configuration file
 that lists all relevant logfiles and lists possible
 log lines that should result in warning or critical
 state. The windows agents does not need any configuration
 but sends all log files in the Windows event log.
 It uses the warning/error classification of Windows.

 Relevant log messages found by the agent are stored
 locally into a text file. The check is critical, if
 at least one new {or old} log message exists that
 is classified as critical. If at least one warning
 message exists but no critical, the check results
 in a warning state.

 The only way to bring the state back to OK is to
 delete the text file with the stored log messages.
 This is stored below {/var/lib/check_mk/logwatch}.
 Usually the logwatch webpage is used to browse and
 delete the messages. Please refer to the online
 documentation of check_mk for more details about logwatch.

item:
 The name of the logfile. For Linux/UNIX this is
 the complete absolute path name of the logfile.
 For Windows this is the name as shown in the 
 windows event log, for example {Application} (case
 sensitive!).

inventory:
 All logfiles sent by the agent are automatically
 inventorized. Please use standard inventory configuration
 methods if you want to ignore certain log files.


examples:
  logwatch_patterns = {
     "System":             [ ('W', "crash"), 
                             ('I', "svchost") ],
     "/var/log/messages":  [ ( ['test'], ALL_HOSTS, 'I', "sshd") ]
  }

[parameters]
patterns (list): The parameter can be used to reclassify
 log messages sent by the agent. You can assign one of
 the three levels {'I'} (ignore), {'W'} (warning) or
 {'C'} (critical) to each message. It is only possible
 to reclassify messages with an original level of {W} or {C}.
 Each entry of the list is a pair of the new level and an
 extended regular expression searched in the log line.
 Please note, that because logwatch checks are usually
 inventorized, it is easier to use the global configuration variable
 {logwatch_patterns} instead of explicit check parameters.
 Example: {[ ('I', "sshd"), ('C', "foo.*bar") ]}

[configuration]
logwatch_patterns (dict): A dictionary for reclassifying
 the level of certain messages. This is especially useful
 for the Window agent, since that uses the pre-classification
 of Windows and might not meet your needs. The key of each entry is the name
 of a logfile (see {item}). The value of each entry is
 a list of pairs as described in {parameters}. It is also
 possible to restrict entries to single hosts or groups
 of hosts by prepending list of host and host tags to the pairs,
 as seen in the example.

logwatch_dir (string): Directory where log messages are
 stored. The default value is {/var/lib/check_mk/logwatch}.
 For each host a subdirectory is created. The name of the 
 files therein are the names of the logfiles with slashes
 replaced by backslashes.
