description:
 This is an active check that connects to a database server, sends an sql
 statement to that server, and checks for the following result:

    The query must return two columns, a number and a text, plus
    optional performance data.
    If upper and lower levels are given, the number is being checked
    against these levels and the according state is being computed. 
    Otherwise the number ist treated as a Nagios state (0,1,2,3).
    State, text and the optional performance data are being returned

 The check works with mysql, postgres and oracle databases using the
 python drivers MySQLdb, psycopg2 and cx_Oracle. For cx_oracle the
 oracle-instantclient needs to be installed as well, and the 
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be modified to point to the libclntsh.so of 
 that package.

 This check can be configured by Wato.
