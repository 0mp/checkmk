description:
 This checks monitors hardware sensors reported by the tool
 OpenHardwareMonitor (http://openhardwaremonitor.org/). check_mk
 includes a stripped down version of OpenHardwareMonitor without
 a gui component which can be installed through the agent backery
 or manually.
 If the check_mks own version of ohm is used and installed correcty,
 the windows agent will ensure it is run (and restarted) as
 necessary.

 This check currently monitors Temperature-, Fan-, Clock- and
 Power-Sensors for all devices supported by the tool.
 GPU sensors will not work when using the stripped down version of
 OHM. This is because windows services have no access to display
 devices (session 0 isolation).

 Only temperature sensors have levels by default based on device
 type.
 For fans, level can be configured but the default is to not warn,
 as OHM may report disconnected fans or fans that are regulated
 by temperature.
 Other check items are informational only.

item:
 The name of the sensor as reported by OpenHardwareMonitor

inventory:
 All available sensors are automatically inventorized.
