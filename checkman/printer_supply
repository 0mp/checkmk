description:
 This check monitors the remaining filling level in percent of a printers
 supplys like toner or fuser. The printer has to support the generic
 PRINTER-MIB.
 The default check levels are 20% (warning) and 10% of the full level
 (critical).
 This levels can be redefined with printer_supply_default_levels = ( w, c ).
 According the PRINTER-MIB it's possible that a printer couldn't determine
 how much is remaining in a supply, so the printer says "some remaining".
 This value produces a warning.

perfdata:
