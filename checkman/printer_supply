description:
 This check monitors the remaining filling level in percent of a printers
 supplys like toner or fuser. The printer has to support the generic
 PRINTER-MIB.
 The default check levels are 20% (warning) and 10% of the full level
 (critical).
 According the PRINTER-MIB it's possible that a printer couldn't determine
 how much is remaining in a supply, so the printer says "some remaining".
 This value produces a warning.

 Please note, that some manufactures do not have unique names for
 their supply units in the MIB. They for example name all for toner
 units {Toner Cartridge OKI DATA CORP}. In that case, only the first
 unit will be checked (which does not make much sense). A future version
 of the check might handle that problem - the current one not.

perfdata: 
 The remaining filling level in units (pages remaining).

inventory:
 One check is being created for each supply unit with a unique name.
