title: CPU load on HP-UX
agents: hpux
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures and checks the averaged CPU load. The values
 for 1, 5 and 15 minute average are sent, although the PNP template
 shipped with check_mk only displays the 1 and 15 min average load.

 This check is compatible with the check {cpu.loads} of the linux
 agent.

examples:
 # Set default levels to a load of 4 and 8 per CPU
 cpuload_default_levels = (4.0, 8.0).

 checks = [
    # Use levels 4 per CPU (warning) and 8 per CPU (critical)
    # on all hosts with the tag "linux"
    (["hp"], ALL_HOSTS, "hpux_cpu", None, (4, 8)),
 ]
perfdata:
  Three values: The load average for 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

inventory:
  One service is created if the agent outputs valid data.
