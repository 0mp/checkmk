description:
 This checks monitors fibre channel ports of devices supporting the fibre
 channel management (FCMGMT) MIB, notably Dell fibre channel switches.
 Monitored are the physical, operational, or adminstrative state of the ports,
 the number of received and transmitted objects (RxObjects, TxObjects),
 the incoming and outgoing throughput derived from the number of received
 and transmitted elements (RxElements, TxElements), and the following
 error counters: CRC errors, Enc-OUT frames, no Tx credits, C3 discards.

 The check has a non-OK state in the following situations:

 {[1]} The physical, operational, or adminstrative state of the port is not
 as expected.

 {[2]} The current or averaged throughput exceeds the configured absolute or
 relative levels.

 {[3]} One of the error counters exceeds its configured levels.

 Averaging: This check supports averaging on all counters. Averaging is
 turned on but setting the check parameter {"average"} to a number of minutes.
 In this case the check produces additional performance data for each parameter
 and all warning/error levels are only applied on the averaged value, not on
 the current one. This is especially helpful when using levels on the throughput.

 Note: The counters CRC errors and Enc-OUT are represented as percentages in
 relation to the number of received frames. C3 discards and no Tx credits are
 in relation to the number of sent frames.

item:
 The item is the port-number as two-digit or three-digit string (on switches
 with 100 or more ports) as printed on the switch (note: the SNMP index of
 port {00} is {1}!). If configured, port names of the device will be part
 of the check item (and thus the service description).

examples:
 # Turn on averaging with 15 Minutes on all ports:
 fc_port_default_levels["average"] = 15

 # Alternative: set all default parameters at once:
 fc_port_default_levels = {
    "rxcrcs":           (3.0, 20.0),   # allowed percentage of CRC errors
    "rxencoutframes":   (3.0, 20.0),   # allowed percentage of Enc-OUT Frames
    "notxcredits":      (3.0, 20.0),   # allowed percentage of No Tx Credits
    "c3discards":       (3.0, 20.0),   # allowed percentage of C3 discards
    "assumed_speed":    2.0,           # used, if speed not available in SNMP data
    "bw":               (80.0, 90.0),  # percentual levels for throughput
    "average":          30,            # apply all levels on 30 minute average
 }

 # modify the default monitoring states for the various states of the device
 fc_port_admstates = {
                1: ('unknown', 1),
                2: ('online', 0),
                3: ('offline', 1),
                4: ('bypassed', 1),
                5: ('diagnostics', 0),
 }

                1: ('unknown', 1),
                2: ('unused', 1),

                4: ('warning', 1),
                5: ('failure', 2),
                6: ('not participating', 1),
                7: ('initializing', 1),
                8: ('bypass',1),
                9: ('ols', 0),

 fc_port_phystates = {

                2: ('failed', 2),
                3: ('bypassed', 1),

                5: ('loopback', 1),
                6: ('txfault', 1),
                7: ('noMedia', 1),
                8: ('linkDown',2),
 }

perfdata:
  For each port the following performance data are collected: {in}, {out},
  {rxobjects}, {txobjects}, {rxcrcs}, {rxencoutframes}, {c3discards}
  and {notxcredits}. If averaging is turned on, for each of these
  values the average is also gathered and plotted. {_avg} is appended to
  the averages. All rates are in Bytes/s or Objects/s. If you are using
  PNP4Nagios, you are strongly encouraged to set {RRD_STORAGE_TYPE = MULTIPLE}
  in {process_perfdata.cfg}. You need to re-create or convert existing RRD
  database if you change this setting.

inventory:
  The inventory creates checks for all operational ports. It can be configured
  (see CONFIGURATION VARIABLES) how operational ports are defined.
  Ports with the admininstrative state of 1 (unkown) or 3 (offline) are not
  inventorized.
