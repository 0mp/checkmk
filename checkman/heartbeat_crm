description:
 This check uses the output of the {crm_mon} command as sent by the Check_MK
 linux agent. The check uses general information from that output like: 
 The last update time of the output, the DC, the number of nodes and the number
 of resources in the cluster.

 The check reports CRITICAL in the following situations: When the "last update"
 time is larger than the threshold (normally {60} seconds), when the number
 of nodes or resources change.

 The check can be run in "naildown" mode by setting the option
 {heartbeat_crm_naildown} to {True}. In this mode the check reports a critical
 state when the DC changes to another node. Otherwise the check will ignore
 changing DCs.

inventory:
 One service will be created on each node of the cluster.

[parameters]
max_age (int): Maximum age of the reported "last status" in seconds.
dc (string): The expected DC of the cluster. The check is disabled when the
 value is set to an empty string.
num_nodes (int): Expected number of nodes in the cluster. The check is disabled
 when the value is set to -1.
num_resources (int): Expected number of resources in the cluster. The check is
 disabled when the value is set to -1.

[configuration]
heartbeat_crm_naildown (bool): Nails down the DC to the node which is the DC
 during inventory. The check will report CRITICAL when another node becomes the
 DC during later checks. If set to "False" the check will be passed.

heartbeat_crm_default_levels (int, string, int, int): Max age of "last updated"
 in seconds, Name of the DC, Number of nodes, Number of resources
