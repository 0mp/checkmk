description:
 This check monitors various counters as found in {/proc/stat}
 and {/proc/vmstat}. Examples for those counters are {ctxt}
 (the number of process context switches per second), {pgmajfault}
 (the number of major page faults per second) and {processes}
 (the number of process creations per second).

 You can set a critical and warning level on each of those
 counters or just monitor them without levels in order to
 collect performance data.

item:
 The name of the kernel counter as found in {/proc/stat} or
 {/proc/vmstat}.

examples:
 # Monitor major page faults, set levels to 200 and 400 per second
 # Do this on all hosts with the tag "lnx"
 checks += [ 
   ( ["lnx"], ALL_HOSTS, "kernel", "pgmajfault", (200, 400) )
 ]

[parameters]
warning (int): The rate per second which triggers a warning

critical (int): The rate per second which triggers a critical state
