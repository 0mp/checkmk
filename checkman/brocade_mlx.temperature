description:
 Checks the temperature sensors in Brocade NetIron MLX switching / routing 
 devices.

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the temperature is above given thresholds.
 {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 The description of the temperature sensor as provided by SNMP.

examples:
 # set default levels to 70°C and 80°C:
 brocade_mlx_temperature_default_levels = (70, 80)

 # Check a sensor with description Switch Fabric module 0, sensor 1 temperature
 # on a box called my-mlx-device with default levels
 checks += [
   ("my-mlx-device", "brocade_mlx.temperature", 'Switch Fabric module 0, sensor 1 temperature', brocade_mlx_temperature_default_levels)
 ]

 # or use individual levels for warn and crit
 checks += [
   ("my-mlx-device", "brocade_mlx.temperature", 'Switch Fabric module 0, sensor 1 temperature', (80, 100)
 ]

perfdata:
 one value is returned: The temperature in °C, together with warn and crit levels

inventory:
 Finds one item per temperature sensor

[parameters]
warn(int): {WARN} state is triggered, if the temperature is higher than this.
crit(int): {CRIT} state is triggered, if the temperature is higher than this.

[configuration]
brocade_mlx_temperature_default_levels(int, int): The standard levels for {WARN}
    and {CRIT}. Defaults are (100, 120)
