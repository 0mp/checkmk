title: Check for running process
agents: linux, windows, aix, solaris, vms

description:
 This check looks into the list of then current running processes for
 those matching a certain name or regular expression. The number of
 matching processes is matched against warning and critical levels.

item:
 A user definable service description for Nagios.
 That description must be unique within each host.
 Changing the description will make Nagios think that
 it is another service.

examples:
 checks += [
   # make sure exactly one ntpd is running
   ( "somehost", "ps", "NTP", ( "/usr/sbin/ntpd", 1, 1, 1, 1 ) ),
   # command lines containing "prefork" should be in range 20 ... 30
   ( "somehost", "ps", "prefork" ( "~.*prefork", 15, 20, 30, 35 ) ),
   # no process containing "sshd" should exist
   ( "somehost", "ps", "SSHD" ( "~.*sshd", 0, 0, 0, 0 ) )
 ]
[parameters]
procname (string): Process specification. This can either be the name of a process as ouput by the agent. It must exactly match the first column of the agents output. Or - if the string is beginning with a tilde - it is interpreted
 as a regular expression that must match the beginning of the process line as output by the agent. For the Linux/UNIX agents this allows you to match specific
 command line arguments of the process.
warnmin (int): Minimum number of matched process for WARNING state
okmin (int): Minimum number for OK state
okmax (int): Maximum number for OK state
warnmax (int): Maximum number for WARNING state. Counts less than warnmin or greater than
 warnmax are CRITICAL
