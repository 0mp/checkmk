title: CPU utilization via SNMP from UCD daemon
agents: snmp
catalog: os/kernel

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the CPU utilization during the last check
 cycle. A level can be set only on {wait} (disk wait). If you
 want to set levels on your CPU usage you better use the check
 {ucd_cpu_load}.

 The information is fetched via SNMP from the UCD SNMP daemon.
 This daemon is mainly found on Linux and is used by some
 hardware appliances (such as Riverbed Steelhead).

perfdata:
 Three variables: The percentage of time spent in {user}, {system} and {wait}
 (disk wait). The idle time can be computed by substracting those three values
 from 100%. The user value contains also {nice}. The system value also contains
 hardware and software interrupts.

inventory:
 One check per host is created if the agent supports the UCD-MIB.
 Currently the SNMP scan function will only consider hosts
 with the text {linux} in their system description. You can
 try an explicit inventory with {cmk --checks ucd_cpu_util -I HOSTNAME}
 if that is not the case.
