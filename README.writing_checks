This file will help you to write *good* checks for Check_MK.

Agent based checks:

* Put sample output snippets of the agent as comments into
  the check source code. Add examples for all cases handled
  by your check. -> That makes the code more easy to understand
  and help not to break something if someone changes something
  in the check's parser.
