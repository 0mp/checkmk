Title: windows agent: "check_mk_agent.exe test" now also outputs stderr of plugins

If you need stdout only simply use <tt>check_mk_agent.exe file myfile</tt>.

This feature also includes a small fix. If a plugin script wrote something to
stderr there was a possibility that the following stdout information was skipped.
This bug was only observed on a Win2k3 system.
