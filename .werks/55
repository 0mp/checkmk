Title: Allow grouping by host, host group or service group
Level: 2

Class: feature

Within the availability reporting there is now a new option <i>Grouping</i>
for grouping by host, host group or service group. When grouping is enabled
then one separate table will be rendered for each host or group that is part
of the selected objects. For objects that are not part of any group (well, this
cannot happen if you group by host) one additional table is being rendered.

<b>Note</b>: objects that are part of more than one group will appear in
more than one table.
