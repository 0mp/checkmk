Title: cisco_vpn_tunnel: Reporting zero traffic in case the tunnel is down
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p16
Date: 1484138387
Class: fix

Previous versions of the check were not providing any performance data in case
the tunnel was down. The graphs were showing flat lines for the time the tunnel
was down which could lead to confusions because in fact there was no traffic
at all.
