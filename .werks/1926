In werk #1563 we moved all parameters for the process check to
a check parameter rule set in normal Check_MK style. Previously
these parameters (like process count, CPU levels, etc.) had been
set only during discovery. But that way existing configuration
with rules for process inventory would not work anymore.

This werk fixes this. All old inventory rule (now called
discovery) work again. Also they are ediable via WATO. You can
set the process parameters now in two places: during discovery
and in the parameter rule. The preferred way is the new way:
to set these in the parameter rule. That way changes will immediately
get active without a need for a new discovery.
