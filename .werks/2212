Title: oracle_tablespaces: Fix plugin output in case of detected problem in Autoextend settings
Level: 1

Class: fix

The checkout would output <tt>NO AUTOEXTEND(!!)</tt> if it had detected that autoextend
was <b>on</b> but should be off. The <tt>NO</tt> has now been removed in order to fix
the output. The vice versa case has also been fixed.
