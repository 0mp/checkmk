Title: IE: Always use the latest available rendering enginge of the used browser

Class: fix

We tell IE to always use the latest available rendering engine instead of a guessed one
or the default one. The user might still override this by choosing a rendering engine
by hand in IE.

This should fix several rendering and JS problems e.g. when using the dashboard designer.
