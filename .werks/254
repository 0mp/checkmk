This feature allows to configure how spaces of VMs in esx hostsystem should be treated.
Hostnames in the monitoring core generally are not allowed to have space.
The new option -S (configurable via a WATO rule) can now set how to handle these spaces:<br>
Option: -S cut -> The virtual machines name is cut after the first space<br>
Option: -S underline -> All spaces of this virtual machine are replaced with underline
