Title: fortigate_cpu, fortigate_memory, fortigate_session: fix SNMP scan function, add WATO rule set for sessions
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b10
Date: 1424443460
Class: fix

The SNMP scan for these checks does not fetch non-standard OIDs anymore. This
is not neccessary since the word "Fortigate" appears in the SNMP sysDescr. The
sessions check is now configurable via WATO.
