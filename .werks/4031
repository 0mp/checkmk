Title: LVM Volume Groups: fixed broken WATO configuration
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.8p18
Date: 1487776356
Class: fix

The WATO rule "Volume Groups (LVM)" created incorrect levels, which never applied.
This has been fixed. You need to reconfigure all LVM Volume Groups rules from scratch, because
their format has changed.
