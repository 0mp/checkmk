When forwarding logwatch log entries to the event console between timezones, the
time of the local time of sending system was used to forward the log entries
without caring about the time zone.

We changed the forwarding code to use unix timestamps for solving the problems
with timezones during forwarding.

You will need to update your event console in order to be able to receive the
new formated messages from remote systems. We recommend to first update your
event console system and then update the sending system.
