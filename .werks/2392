Title: Auth cookie is always using "httponly" flag
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6p6
Date: 1435664667
Class: security

All newly issued authentication cookies have the flag "httponly"
set now. This makes the cookie values inaccessible from scripts
executed in the browser, e.g. from Javascript. This secures the
cookie against some sorts of cookie stealing attempts.

See https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly for details.
