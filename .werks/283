Title: Interface Checks: Counters are now skipped when interface is down

In most cases it was no problem to check the counter values, as they
are reset to zero for most devices. But for some devices, the counters
are still having values - and maybe also change. To handle this, we
simply ignore the counter values for down interfaces.
