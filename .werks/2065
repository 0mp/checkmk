Title: windows agent: now correctly installs service with elevated privileges
Level: 2
Component: checks

Class: fix

The msi package requires administrative privileges to install the files into
the program files directory. These privileges were not forwarded to the action
which actually registers the agent binary as service.
After the installation all files were installed correctly, but no service was registered.
This has been fixed.

Additionally the product version is no longer displayed as 1.0.0.
