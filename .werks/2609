Title: mysql_capacity: Can now handle sizes reported being NULL
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

The discovery is now skipping all databases reported with a size
or capacity of 'NULL'. The check function can also deal with this
situation to prevent crash reports. Users experiencing this situation
should update and rediscover the services of the affected hosts to
remove the useless database checks.
