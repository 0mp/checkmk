Title: Legacy view formats created with 2014-09 snapshots are now converted

Class: fix

Views which have been created with Check_MK snapshots from 2014-09 created
the views in a legacy format which the current multisite code can not interpret.
When an installation has such a view created by any user, ist ot usable anymore
and shows an exception like "if 'service' in hide_filters and 'host' in hide_filters:
TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable".

This has been fixed now. The legacy views are now converted automatically.
They are saved in the new format once the user makes his first change to this
or another view.
