Title: http[s] links are display again in the plugin output
Level: 1
Component: multisite

Class: fix

The multisite GUI now translates html links into <tt>&lt;a href= ..&gt;</tt>
This feature has been introduced to allow at least basic html support in plugin outputs.
If you want to have full html support in plugin output (including the security risks it brings)
you can disable the option "Escape HTML codes in plugin output" in the global settings.
