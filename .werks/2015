Class: fix

Previous versions were unable to send notifications for services with
umlauts in their service descriptions. This issue has been fixed now.
If you miss notifications, take a look at the notification log at
<tt>var/log/notify.log</tt> (in your OMD sites) and search for
exception tracebacks.
