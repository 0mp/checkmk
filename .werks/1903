Title: mk_oracle: Remote Monitoring of Oracle Databases
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427652230
Class: feature

mk_oracle got a major improvement in monitoring Oracle Databases.

This new option allows monitoring a database from another host with a
running check_mk_agent.

H2: Requirements
You need an Oracle Client from Oracle to use this feauture. The Oracle Instant Client
with SQLPlus is a required minimum. You could use an existing Oracle installation as
environment for mk_oracle as well.

The plugin sends the data with piggyback. Please keep in mind, that the agent from the
host with mk_oracle is responsible for the piggyback data. If you put the Check_MK check
in downtime you'll put all other database checks from mk_oracle in a downtime as well.

H2: Configuration
You need an Oracle Client. If ORACLE_HOME is not set in the login shell of root, you need
to add the ORACLE_HOME variable to mk_oracle.mk.

Add the following lines to <tt>mk_oracle.cfg</tt>. The path is an example for the RPM Instant
Client from Oracle for 64bit.
<tt>ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64</tt>

<tt>REMOTE_INSTANCE_1_omd110=check_mk:check_mk:::::XE:11.2</tt>
<tt>REMOTE_INSTANCE_2_omd110=check_mk:check_mk:::::XE2:11.2</tt>

Definition of a REMOTE_INSTANCE:
<tt>REMOTE_INSTANCE_<Number>_<piggyback Hostname>=<Configuration String></tt>

The definition of the database connection is as follows.
<tt><username>:<password>:<sysdba>:<port>:<Database hostname>:<reserved for future use>:<ORACLE_SID>:<ORACLE-Release></tt>

Notes regarding <tt>REMOTE_INSTANCE_x</tt>
You need to make sure, that the name of the variable including
the hostname is unique for every database in <tt>mk_oracle.cfg</tt>.
Only 3 '_' are allowed in front of the piggyback hostname.
Otherwise the plugin won't work correctly. The Oracle Release must
be 9.2, 10.1, 10.2, 11.1, 11.2 or 12.1. No other values are allowed.

Don't forget to use the testmode before starting the inventory on
the monitoring host.

More details could be found on the documentation at Check_MK:
https://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_oracle.html

The testmode is compatible with the remote mode. Details with an
example are shown in the documentation.

H2: Incompatible change:
The compatibility against old sqlplus.sh has been removed. Please
remove an exiting sqlplus.sh and configure
the <tt>mk_oracle.cfg</tt>. This change is a requirement for the
new remote monitoring option and the only reason for this
change.
There is nothing to do when <tr>sqlplus.sh</tr> was not used before this Werk.
