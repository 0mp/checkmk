Title: Reduced I/O on logins with access time recording or failed login counts
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1384158368
Class: fix

In previous versions, these optional features were loading the whole user
configuration just to read / change one attribute of one user, which is kept
in a single file. This mechanism has been recoded to only use this single
custom attribute file. Should reduce I/O in large installations during
multisite processing.
