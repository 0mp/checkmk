Title: Try harder to detect previous hard state in notification when using Nagios as core

In the case where you have more than one check attempt then now the previous
hard state is assumed to be the previous soft state when the new state is
OK or UP. This avoids some cases where the previous state had been set to
<tt>?</tt> in previous versions. The CMC does not have these problems anyway.
