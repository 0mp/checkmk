Title: Remove test-code, Micro Core only worked once per host
Level: 2
Component: core
Version: 1.2.4b2
Date: 1387556838
Class: fix

Due to remaining test-code the file <tt>/tmp/dev_null</tt> was created
instead of <tt>/dev/null</tt>. That way only the first site using
Check_MK Micro Core was working. This has been fixed.
