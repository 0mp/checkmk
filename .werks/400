Title: WATO BI editor now supports percentages for count_ok
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387376299
Class: fix

The WATO module for BI aggregates now can correctly show and edit aggregation
functions of the type <tt>count_ok</tt> that are using percentages instead
of explicit numbers, e.g. <tt>count_ok!60%!30%</tt>.
