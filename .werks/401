Class: fix

When configuring rules for <i>Manual Checks</i> via WATO and
having several rules for the same combination of host, check type
and item, then the <i>last</i> of these rules would specify the
parameters of the check. This has now been fixed and the <i>first</i>
matching rule has precedence.
