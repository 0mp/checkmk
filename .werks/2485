Title: Fix Icon "BI Aggregations containing this service", also avoid BI compilation without need

This werk contains a fix and a speedup: The fix repairs the BI icon that is now contained in
the drop down menu rather than directly in the view. The URL where the icon pointed was broken.
The second change is a speedup: Pages that do not show BI aggregates now do now trigger BI
compilation anymore. This is delayed until the command/icon menu is being opened. Here the
BI icon needs to be displayed and hence the compilation triggered.
