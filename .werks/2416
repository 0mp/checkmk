If the netapp filers shared an even amount of disks on a shelf, the agent had problems
to determine which filer is responsible for the shelf sensors.
In this case it reported "no one is responsible" which lead to missing checks.
This has been fixed. If the disks of a shelf are evenly shared between the filers the
shelf owner is now determined by comparing the system-name with the partner-system-name.
