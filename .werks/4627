Title: apc_symmetra: Fix bogus 100000000 A battery current  occurring on some devices
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

Some APC Symmetra devices react badly to OIDs being polled out of order, leading to
a 1000000000 A being displayed in the check that cannot be seen in an SNMP walk.
The OIDs of this check have been reordered to circumvent this problem.
