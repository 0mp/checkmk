Title: mrpe: tolerate performance variable names with spaces
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387367800
Class: fix

Some bizarre legacy check plugins use spaces in the names of their performance
variables. Nagios allows this under certain circumstances. The <tt>mrpe</tt>
check would fail with an exception, though.

The fix now tolerates spaces, but uses just the last component of the variable
name in that case. All RRD graphs will be created correctly, though with an
incomplete name. In most cases that should be OK.
