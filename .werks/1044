Title: Remove icon for service parameters in WATO service list for missing services

In the services list of a host in WATO in the section <i>Available (missing) services</i>
the icon for the service parameters has been removed. It didn't work properly because
Check_MK cannot safely analyse non-existent services. It is dangerous anyway if the user
thinks he could do configuration for those services.
