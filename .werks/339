Title: blade_bays blade_blades blade_blowers blade_health blade_mediatray blade_powerfan blade_powermod: fix scan function
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387205955
Class: fix

Due to a previous precision in the scan function API the scan functions of
the blade_* checks where never successful anymore. That way those checks
were not detected on new devices.  This has been fixed.  Existing checks
were not affected.
