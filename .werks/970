Title: liveproxyd: handle situations with more then 1024 open files
Level: 2
Component: liveproxy
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1400056696
Class: fix

When you are using the Livestatus Proxy Daemon for connecting lots
of sites and you have lots of concurrent users then two things could
happen:

1. You might run out of files. The reason is that per default on most
Linux systems the number of files a process is allowed to keep open
is limited to 1024. The can be increased by using <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>.
The script launching the <tt>liveproxyd</tt> need to issue a <tt>ulimit -S -n unlimited</tt>
before starting. In the OMD builds of the Check_MK Monitoring System this
has been added for recent development builds. The <tt>liveproxyd</tt> now handles
this situation better and does not long run into a busy CPU loop. It waits for
5 seconds and restarts itself instead.

2. Even if you increased the number of allowed open files the <tt>liveproxyd</tt>
could never open more than 1024 files on most Python versions (due to a limit of
the system call <tt>select()</tt>. This has been fixed by using the <tt>poll()</tt>
system call.
