Title: aix_if: Make check work with different ifconfig output format
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p24
Date: 1496911872
Class: fix

On some systems, the operational status information is listed under
"KIM Driver Flags" instead of simply "Driver Flags", which previously
could not be parsed correctly by the check. This has been fixed.
