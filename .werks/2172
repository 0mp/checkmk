Title: Allowing OIDs in checks not starting with a dot again
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6p1

Class: fix

Within Check_MK it is not allowed to use SNMP OIDs not starting with a ".".
The last release introduced a check which forced all users to fix the SNMP OID
declarations which don't start with a dot.

Because many users had problems with this error, e decided to make this check less
restrictive. The check accepts the missing dots now and adds it silently for
internal processing. Only in debug mode such OID definitions leads to an exception.
