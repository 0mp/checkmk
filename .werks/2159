Title: netapp_api_disk.summary: Changed default thresholds to WARN on the first broken disk, CRIT on 50%
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6p1
Date: 1427284350
Class: fix

The thresholds are configured using percentage levels on the broken to spare disk ratio.
Previous versions of the check simply did not apply levels on the number of broken disks
except you configured the ratio. We have added a default ratio of 1% for WARN and 50% for
CRIT.
