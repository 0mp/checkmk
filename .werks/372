Title: megaraid_ldisks: Ignoring adapters without configured logical disks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387218819
Class: fix

Previous versions of this check did simply fail with an exception if an
adapter has no logical disks configured. This change makes the inventory
function simply ignore those adapters.
