Title: Creating WATO lock during automations (like e.g. master to slave syncs)
Level: 1
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.4b6

Class: fix

All actions within WATO which might modify config files are globally locked.
This prevents mixups in written files. Only the automation commands did not
use a lock which might lead into broken files when some manual action
and some pushed snapshot wrote a file at the same time. The automations
now use the same lock as user actions which should prevent such problems now.
