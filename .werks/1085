Title: quicksearch: multiple hostname matches now lead to the searchhost view instead of the hosts view
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i5
Date: 1405937822
Class: feature

When a quicksearch pattern matched multiple hosts the view hosts was shown.
This view also displayed all services for these hosts, which could lead
to plenty of (unwanted) output in the view.
<br>
The quicksearch feature has been changed in the following way<br>

<ul>
<li>If there are multiple host matches the searchhost view is displayed</li>
<li>If there is a single match the hosts view is displayed (this view also contains the services)</li>
</ul>

Note: This also applies to special search patterns like <tt>h:localhost h:otherhost</tt>
