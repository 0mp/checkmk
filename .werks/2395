Title: Fix conflict with legacy check_mk-agent-logwatch package in default RPM packages
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1435925490
Class: fix

When you install the default Check_MK Agent RPM package it will trigger the removal of
the previously installed check-mk-agent, check_mk-agent and check_mk-agent-logwatch
RPM packages. Please note that this agent does not ship the mk_logwatch plugin, so
you will need to install the mk_logwatch plugin in your own.

If you want to have the Check_MK Agent RPM package contain the plugins you need and
are a happy user with access to the Check_MK Enterprise Edition, you can use the
Agent Bakery to create your custom packed RPM packages.
