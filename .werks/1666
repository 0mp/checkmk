Title: inventory check esx_vsphere_hostsystem: no longer crashes if information is missing
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b2
Date: 1418742995
Class: fix

In certain scenarios (which still need to be investigated) the hostsystem does
not report any information for the node "hardware.cpuPkg", which caused an exception in the
inventory check esx_vsphere_hostsystem.
