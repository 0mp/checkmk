Title: Fixed case where "activate changes" was not commiting the pending changes entries correctly

It could happen that activate changes was not commiting the pending changes entries correctly
after applying the changes. Right after activation the changes look ok, but when coming back to
another WATO page, the changes are visible as pending again.
