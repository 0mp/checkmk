Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i5p3
Date: 1408465511

This inventory function of the check crashed when there was a filesystem
with a space in the filesystem type. We have seen one filesystem with
the type <tt>PlayStation(R)3 File System</tt>. This has been fixed now.
