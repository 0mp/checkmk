Title: check_mail, check_mail_loop: fixed incorrect POP3 ssl setting (thanks to Bernhard Schmidt)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6p10
Date: 1438345949
Class: fix

The logic in the POP3 WATO configuration is wrong, it sets ssl to True
when "Use no encryption" is selected and to False when "Encrypt POP3
communication using SSL" is selected.
