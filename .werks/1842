Title: Rewrote implementation of service discovery (formerly inventory)
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b7
Date: 1421339331
Class: fix

The internal code for the service discovery has been writting. The previous
name for that feature was "inventory" but the word inventory is now being
used for hardware/software-inventory. The option <tt>--check-inventory</tt>
has been renamed into <tt>--check-discovery</tt>.

Several bugs have been fixed while doing the new implementation. One prominent
bug was service discovery on clusters. Another problem that has been fixed
was that when during <tt>cmk -II</tt> a host was not reachable its services
would have been lost.
