Title: windows agent: logwatch: no longer reports incorrect formatted texts (japanese characters)

Class: fix

Sometimes the windows agent read error texts out of dll files.
Most dll files were prefixed with <tt>%SystemRoot%</tt> which gets replaced by the real path.

However, there were instances were the prefix was <tt>%windir%</tt>.
This placeholder was not replaced correctly. As a result the dll were not found,
which lead to incorrect formatted texts.
