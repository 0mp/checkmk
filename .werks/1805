Title: Changing roles marks sites where users can login dirty for sync now

Class: fix

Previously a change to the roles did not result in a pending change for remote
sites in a distributed WATO setup. To have these changes synchronized one needed
to make another change to mark the sites dirty and make the sync possible.

This has been changed now. Each site can now be configured to make "user logins
to Web GUI possible", which is enabled by default. Those sites will be marked as
dirty now which will make the admin able to trigger a synchronisation right
after modifying a role.
