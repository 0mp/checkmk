Title: jolokia_metrics.mem: PNP-Template now handles non existant max values
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387277786
Class: fix

With some application servers the maximum values for memory are not provided
by the agent. The checks did already handle this, but the PNP graph could
not be displayed in this case.
