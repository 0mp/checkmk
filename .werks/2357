Title: livestatus_status: no not alarm switched off host freshness nor event handlers on CMC <= 1.2.6
Level: 2
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i1p3
Date: 1435059274

CMC version 1.2.6 did not have event handlers. So they are always switched
off. The check will no longer warn about this. Host freshness checking is
turned off per default in OMD based installations for the Nagios core. Per
default alerting this also has been disabled.
