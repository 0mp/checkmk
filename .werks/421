Title: UserDB: Fixed lost passwords when changing users in large user databases
Level: 1

This issue affects local users whose passwords are stored in the local htpasswd
file. When saving users after modification, the htpasswd file might corrupt and
invalidate all passwords of all users. This has been fixed now.
