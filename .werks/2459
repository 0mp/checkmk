Title: Preventing caching of all HTTP requests to dynamic pages (*.py)

Class: fix

Especially when opening Check_MK GUI using some kind of proxy or traffic
optimizer it might have happened that those devices were serving cached
 (outdated) pages to the user. This was done because the Check_MK GUI
did not set the HTTP headers correctly (when using form based authentication).
This has been fixed now by always setting "Cache-Control: no-cache" for
all dynamic created pages.
