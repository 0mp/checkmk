Title: cisco_temperature: Fixed behaviour in cases where device reports status but no temperature
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6p2

Class: fix

Previously, the check would report unknown in cases where the device reports an ok status but no valid
temperature. This behaviour differed from the way the old cisco_temp_perf check handled this. This has
been fixed to be consistent with the old behaviour.
