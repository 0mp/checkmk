Title: win_printers: Fixed creation of duplicate services
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1

Class: fix

Longer printer names were stripped and could result in duplicate services
found. This patch extends the terminal width of the agent plugin and prevents
stripping of chars.

Thanks to Andreas DÃ¶hler for submitting the patch.
