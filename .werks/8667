Title: fixed missing patchlevel in inventory data of SuSE 12.1 and 12.2
Level: 1
Component: inv
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p19

Class: fix

SuSE 12 SP1 and SP2 are reporting a fourth line in /etc/SuSE-release to use /etc/os-release in future versions.
This line prevented detecting the patchlevel in HW/SW inventory. This has been fixed by a workaround until development of /etc/os-release integration has finished.
