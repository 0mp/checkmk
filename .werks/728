Title: mem.win: fixed bug in WATO configuration rule
Level: 1
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.4p1
Date: 1394038275
Class: fix

The WATO configuration showed "Absolute used pagefile" (and memory) as configurable limits.
The check instead interpreted this value as "Absolute free pagefile".
This has been fixed. WATO now shows "Absolute free pagefile", too.

Additionally the configured value was off by a factor of 1024 * 1024.
