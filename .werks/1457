Class: fix

The "users" check and "mk_users" plugin have been renamed to "logins" and
"mk_logins".  If you have utilized the "users" check before, you now need
to remove the "mk_users" plugin and install the "mk_logins" plugin on your
monitoring clients.  Afterwards, you need to execute a new service discovery.
