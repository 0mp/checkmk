Title: local: Catch invalid state codes and map to 3 (UNKNOWN)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1

Class: fix

If the the state of a line of the <tt>local</tt> section is
not in the allowed range (from <tt>0</tt> to <tt>3</tt>) then
we now assume <tt>3</tt>. Up to now Check_MK ran into an exception.
