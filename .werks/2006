Title: services: Add WATO rule for configuring parameters of discovered checks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b10

Class: fix

Up to now you could only select under which conditions a Windows service would
be discovered - but later it would be checked for <tt>running</tt> / <tt>auto</tt>.
Now you can select the target state via a new WATO rule set <i>Windows Services</i>.
