Title: prefer ucd_mem over hr_mem in case of pfSense monitoring
Level: 1

Class: fix

If monitoring pfSense firewalls the hr_mem check does not provide the right data. Because of this ucd_mem is preferred here.

The change is incompatible because you have to rediscover the affected hosts so ucd_mem is used instead of hr_mem.
