Title: barracuda_mailqueues, nullmailer_mailq, postfix_mailq, qmail_stats: these checks now have items, postfix can now monitor multi directories (linux agent)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1475141806
Class: feature

If postfix is configured with multi directories then the linux agent provides information
about deferred and active mail queue length of these directories.

Note: existing ruleset mailqueue length is now deprecated. These checks will
work further on but the related ruleset won't be applied any more except default levels.
Please use new service descriptions for these checks below global settings, rediscover the
affected hosts and use new mail queue length ruleset.
