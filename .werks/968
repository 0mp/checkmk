Title: Notification plugins now configurable via WATO
Level: 2
Component: notifications

Class: feature

Check_MK now has a new alternative API for notification script, which allows
them to be configured via WATO. The classical API provided the possibility of
a list of strings that was passed to the script as <tt>PARAMETER_1</tt>,
<tt>PARAMETER_2</tt>, etc. The new API passes arguments according
to keys in a configured dictionary, like <tt>PARAMETER_FROM</tt> and
<tt>PARAMETER_REPLY_TO</tt>.

Two notification scripts have been converted to use the new API: <tt>mail</tt>
(sending HTML emails) and <tt>mkeventd</tt> (forwarding to the Event Console).

The configuration of a notification script does only work with the new
<i>Rule Based Notifications</i> can be done at two places:

<ul>
<li>In new rulesets below <i>Host &amp; Service Parameters</i> &rarr; <i>Monitoring Configuration</i> &rarr; <i>Notifications</i></li>
<li>Right in a notification rule</li>
</ul>

Both configurations are being merged on a per-key basis. That way you
can e.g. setup a <tt>From:</tt> header for your outgoing emails via
a global rule, but select various different <tt>Reply-To:</tt> addresses
in different notification rules.

If a configuration key appears both in <i>Host &amp; Service Parameters</i> and
in a notification rule then the latter one has precedence.
