Title: windows agent: unicode logfile monitoring: now able to detect incomplete written lines

Class: fix

There were instances where a logline was not fully written to a unicode file.

For example
C+:
This is the first line
This is the sec
C-:

In this scenario the agent is not allowed to parse the second line, because
it has not been fully written to disk yet. A complete line is considered to
be finished with a carriage return followed by a newline.<br><br>

With this update the agent now stops parsing after the first line and
continues at the start of the second line on the following agent query.
Note: This only applies to utf-8 files
