Title: LDAP: Fixed sync when non lower case attributes are configured
Level: 1

Class: fix

The LDAP sync converts all configured ldap attributes to lower case
for easier handling internally. When custom LDAP source attributes
are configured by using non lower case, the sync did not process
those vars in some cases.
