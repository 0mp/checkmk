Class: fix

If you enter html entities in input fields, the value will be saved correctly.
If you open the rule for editing again, the value will be interpreted. This
replaces html entities with the interpreted character. If you save the rule
now, all html entities will be lost.

One example:
C+:
You enter &#46;
Will be replaced with . (Dot)
C-:

This bug was reported by a customer who have used check_http for finding html
entities in a webpage.
