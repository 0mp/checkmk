Title: oracle_jobs: avoid broken checks, make compatible with old version
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6p3
Date: 1415888257
Class: fix

After the introduction of the necessary job owner, previous checks would fail
until reinventorized. This has been fixed. The check is now compatible with
old checks where the job owner is not yet contained in the item.
