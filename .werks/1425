Title: New section header option "encoding"
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1414421080
Class: feature

If you write your own check plugins you might know that a section
header can contain additional options separated by a colon.
For example:

F+:
<<<lnx_distro:sep(124):persist(141442125)>>>
F-:

An additional option <tt>encoding</tt> has been introduced.
Generally all check plugins should output valid utf-8 encoded text.
In some instances this is not possible, because the plugin itself
has its own hardcoded encoding. With the encoding option you can specify
the encoding for this entire section.

Check_MK will decode the given section output and recode it into utf-8 for
further processing.
