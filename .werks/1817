Title: The Check_MK service did not result in CRITICAL/WARNING states when using Nagios as core

Class: fix

When using Nagios (or Icinga) as monitoring core, the "Check_MK" services was always resulting
in an OK state, even when the output reported that it has a critical problem, for example
because of the agent of the monitored host can not be reached.

This bug seem to be existant since Mon, 15 Dec 2014.
