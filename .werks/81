Title: stored snmpwalks now get correct encoding of binary values

Class: fix

In stored snmpwalks up to now binary values were stored in their binary
representation which caused problems when reading them. Now they are
stored in their ASCII representation.

Furthermore for producing stored walks the inline snmp is never used.
Storedwalks are allways created by the command line tools no regard what
the Global Setting is set to.
