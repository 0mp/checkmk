Title: New summary page with all settings of a host

In WATO there is now a new summary page for each host, called <i>Settings
host host...</i>. In this page you can see all of the host's settings that are
determined by rules (via <i>Host &amp; Service Parameters</i>).  You will only
see the current setting of each paramter, but also whether it is determined
by one or more matching rules or whether it is the factory default value.
A click brings you directly to the according rule set or even rule. This all
makes it much simpler to get an overview over all <i>effective</i> settings
of a host and also gives you a fast access to each setting.
