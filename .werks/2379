Title: Plugin-Output: Fixed handling of URLs within output of check_http
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

By default the plugin outputs are searched for URLs which are then replaced
by a "world" icon which links to this URL. This find/replace pattern was
not working correctly with the URLs provided by the check_http plugin which
surrounds the URLs with <tt>'</tt> characters.
