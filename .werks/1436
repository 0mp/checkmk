Title: quicksearch: search with multiple patterns (h: / s:) no longer discards the host pattern

The host filter name of the target page was renamed from <tt>host</tt> to <tt>host_regex</tt>.
The quicksearch still used the old filter name to insert this data. Therefore the host pattern
data got discarded.
