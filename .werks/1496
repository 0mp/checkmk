Class: fix

When a user without permission to publish a dashboard created or customized a dashboard,
the dashboard could be saved, but resulted in an exception later during rendering the
following pages. This fix prevents creation of damages dashboards.

The exception can be fixed by removing the dashboard definition from var/check_mk/web/USER/user_dashboards.mk
or simply removing the whole file, which would delete all custom dashboards of the user.
