Title: jolokia_metrics.threads: Prevent service staleness in case of decreasing threads
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p19
Date: 1490189869
Class: fix

Previously, the check would go stale occasionally due to a decreasing number of threads
being interpreted as a counter wrap. This has been fixed.
