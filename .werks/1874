Title: ps: Old process inventory configurations work now again
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Since werk #1563 we migrated the way the process inventory is being
configured.

The intention was that old style configurations remain working after
an upgrade. This compatibility was broken and has been fixed again.
