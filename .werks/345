Title: Linux agent: fix detaching of background plugins
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1

Class: fix

The asynchronous execution of background processes in the Linux agent has
been fixed. Before it could have happened that the agent starts background
processes but - however - waits for all of them to finish until finishing
itself. This has now been fixed. All plugins started with run_cached are
now correctly detached from the agent.
