Title: Fixed actions for duplicate host names on different sites
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6p9
Date: 1437047135
Class: fix

When executing actions, for example setting downtimes, on equal named hosts
existing in different sites, previous versions did only execute the action
for the first site. The actions for the equal named hosts/services were
not performed on the other sites.
