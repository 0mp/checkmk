Title: Timeperiods as exceptions can only be selected after saving the rule
Component: wato

This is a nasty interface problem (for the user)
If you add a timeperiod, the exception (text) field is visible,
but the dropdown for selecting a timeperiod exception is not.
If you save the rule and go back to edit mode, then the dropdown
is there.
