Title: ldap debug logfile gives problems with distributed monitoring
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2015-03-18 10:03:24
Targetversion: 1.2.6
Class: bug

when configuring debug mode for the ldap connector a name for a logfile is suggested, which is in the 
monitoring site. When using distributed monitoring, this setting is moved to the remite site. Since
the logfile name does not exist on the remote site and cannot be created, the restart of the remote site
fails.
The same problem happens when using 'omd mv'
