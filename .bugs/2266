Targetversion: 1.2.7

Anyway we should move the log messages of the LDAP connecttor
to some central place. It needn't be a separate Logfile. We should
create one central multisite.log or the like and put everything there.
With log levels and a similar format as cmc.log.

Introduced var/log/web.log for multisite logging.
