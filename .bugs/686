Title: Dashboard/Sidebar on Chrome sometimes not sized
Component: multisite
State: open

It seems like we miss an initial resize() event on Chrome.
This affects both the sidebar and the dashboard. Can we
simulate that event somehow? Currently the dashboard
and sidebar sometimes only work after a manual resize
of the browser window.
