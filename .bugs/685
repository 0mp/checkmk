Title: Logout or password change and relogin leads to side.py
Component: multisite

Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

When logging out and in again - or when you are logged out due
to a password change - then you are not logged into the main
frameset but into side.py (or whatever frame had done the
logout int the first place).

Happens with cookie based authentication.
