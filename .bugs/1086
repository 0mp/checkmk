Title: Exception in views when EC views are missing

When you enabled the Event Console, modify an EC view and afterwards
disabled the EC again, then the views the modified views base on
are missing - and also the columns and filters. This leads to exceptions
in other views.

Solution: validate views, catch exceptions.
