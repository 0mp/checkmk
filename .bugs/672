Title: Hosts with 4.000 services in replicated WATO fail
Component: wato

Class: bug

When a host has many services and you save a manual check
configuration for a host on a slave site, then the command
line for curl is getting too large. This does not even output
a useful error message.

Solution: put the post data into a tmp file (yurks) - optimally
only if it is too large.
