Title: Hosts with many services in replicated WATO ->  Request-URI Too Large

Class: bug

When a host has many services and you save a manual check
configuration for a host on a slave site, then the internal
web services the remotely does inventory creates a too large
URL. Either convert this to POST or send the list of 
services as a Python object as the body of the request.
