Title: Discovery check lifes in history
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2016-02-09 15:25:38
Targetversion: 1.2.7

After Changing a rule like Diskstat Diskcovery mode and a re discovery every seams fine. But some times later the Check_MK Discovery Check
reports unchecked services. But if you then reschedule the Discovery Service by hand, everything is fine again

2016-04-19 14:20:17: changed state open -> works4me
Should work now.
