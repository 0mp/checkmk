When Nagios is restarted (e.g. via WATO), then for a short time the
Livestatus socket is gone. This leads to error messages in various
places - e.g. snapins and also AJAX functions which produce jQuery
errors.

We need to find a solution for a cleaner handling of this. Couldn't
be a site in the state "restarting". If yes - how can we detect such
a state. The livestatus socket is missing in such a case.
