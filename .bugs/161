This avoids problem on some devices. Might other introduce new ones.
So I'm not sure what to do here. From the manpage of snmpwalk:

-Cc Do not check whether the returned OIDs are increasing.  Some agents
(LaserJets are an example) return OIDs out of order, but can complete the walk
anyway.  Other agents return OIDs that are out of order and can cause
snmpwalk to loop indefinitely.  By default, snmpwalk tries to detect
this behavior and warns you when it hits an agent acting illegally.
Use -Cc to turn off this check.
