In some strange cases WATO seems to loose services:

> I’m having a problem where services added via WATO will just disappear if
> you run check_mk –O.
> 
> Today I added a new group of some 5 devices, via WATO.  I selected some
> (snmp) services – various ports and interfaces.  Several were auto added
> – temperature, fans, etc.
> 
> I then activated the configuration, again via WATO.  Then checked the hosts,
> and all services were there and polling.  Everything was good.
> 
> Later I edited some (completely unrelated) hosts via the files in
> etc/check_mk/conf.d and ran check_mk to activate my changes.  I noticed that I
> lost about 100 services from my totals when the new configuration activated.
> A check showed that my new hosts (and several older ones, too) has lost all
> of their services – including the automatic ones!  The only remaining
> services were legacy services that I had much earlier added (globally)
> via editing files.
