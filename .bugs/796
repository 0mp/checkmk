In the very very rare and unbelievable case that the Check_MK check
itself crashes - the output of the Check in Nagios is currently '(null)'.
We should try to wrap the whole code in some general exception handling
(at least the precompiled code). If any exception appears, we should

1. Make the check result with 3 (UNKNOWN)
2. Make the str(exception) be the plugin output
3. Optionally put the exception trace into the long output
4. If the debug log is active, then also log into that something
