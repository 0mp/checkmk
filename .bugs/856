Title: Report scheduler doesn't pass "Group of Host" filter to the report

If you create a Report with context "Hostgroup", add a View with Service
errors, this will work but not when the report is used in the scheduler. If
the scheduler is used, the report shows all systems regradless of the given
hostgroup.
