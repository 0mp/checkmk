When doing a restart of Nagios or a config check while running
under OMD, then better not call the start scripts directly, but
use omd to do this 'omd restart nagios'.

Solution: if we detect OMD then do not use the value from defaults,
but directly call 'omd re{start,load} core'.

Problem is: I've just fixed a problem in OMD (2011-08-22), that
makes 'omd restart core' work in the first place.

--> better wait a time until all Check_MK users surely use 
    OMD versions that have that fix.
