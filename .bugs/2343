Title: cmk --inventory-as-check does not take into account disabled services

Class: bug

If I disable the 'Log .*$' Services with a 'Disable Services' rule,
cmk --inventory-as-check still reports the unchecked Log services,
even if I also disable the logwatch _check_. It also reports the unchecked
DISK IO Summary Service, even though we have choosen to use the detailed
DISK IO view only.

If I only disable the logwatch _check_, but not the _service_,
cmk --inventory-as-check works as expected, i.e. no unchecked services
are reported, neither logwatch not DISK IO Summary services.
