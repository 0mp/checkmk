Title: Cloning rules in WATO should jump to edit page, not directly clone
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2015-06-29 12:40:32
Targetversion: future
Class: nastiness

It should work like in most other place in WATO: Clicking clone should not instantly copy
a rule but enter the "Create new rule" dialog prefilled with all the values from the rule.
In a hidden variable we can save the position of the rule to be created so that it will
be a direct neighbor of the clone rule.
