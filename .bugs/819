sorry to report a bug regarding the new apache_status in 1.2.0p3.

I confirmed on the english mailing list, that also other people have the problem.
We get the same result on auto-detecting and specifying server and port:
./apache_status

Exception (192.168.2.28:80): addinfourl instance has no attribute 'getcode'[root@www local]#

We tested the server-status url with lynx and it is working fine.

CentOS release 5.6 (Final) 32-Bit
httpd-2.2.3-65.el5.centos
