Class: bug

The reason is clear: BI is a pure mulitisite feature. But the wish to have the aggregations
groups of other sites shown is also clear. It could be solved like in the WATO folder snapin
before 1.1.13. Simply create links to the other sites BI aggregation groups which open
the multisite BI GUI of the other site.
