Title: Multisite: cut down number of Livestatus queries
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.3i3
Class: nastiness

Currently for each page one query of SET status is being done.
On low-latency connections this hurts. We could either do without
that or let liveproxyd cache that kind of query. We could make
the Heartbeat of the liveproxyd query exactly the same columns
as Multisite needs for its status-query and then simply answer
with a cached result.

Also we should cache queries needed for the search filters that
are contained in many views. The caching could be done by
the livproxyd.
