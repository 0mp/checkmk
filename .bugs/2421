Title: GIT mode in WATO ignores changes in subfolders
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2016-02-10 14:34:10
Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

Reason: invalid conf.d/.gitignore.

Is:
*
!wato
!wato/*

Should be:

*
!wato
!wato/**

Problem: This file is just created once when the feature is enabled.
Wenn need to fix this in existing installations!
