Title: Make multisite optional username from configured environment vars
Component: multisite
Class: feature
State: done
Date: 2013-01-22 14:49:10
Targetversion: 1.4.0

For example X_FORWARDED_USER or REMOTE_USER should be usable as "user" within
multisite. At the moment we only use req.user, which seem only to be set, when
one really authenticated with the local webserver.
In case of some reverse proxy setups and single sign on environments, this is
not possible. Make it configurable, disabled by default!
