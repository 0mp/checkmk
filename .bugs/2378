Title: check_bi_aggr: $HOSTNAME$ in aggregation name does not work with CMC
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2015-09-21 15:43:27
Targetversion: 1.2.6
Class: bug

The reason seems to be, that $HOSTNAME$ is correctly be added
to the command line arguments, but they are put into the commandlie
as $ARG1$. The CMC does not recursively expand macros in $ARG1$, so
$HOSTNAME$ keeps unexpanded. Recursive expansion is not a good idea,
however! Maybe we need to redefine the API for active checks here...
