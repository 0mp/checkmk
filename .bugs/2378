Title: check_bi_aggr: $HOSTNAME$ in aggregation name does not work correctly with CMC

Class: bug

If you use $HOSTNAME$ as part of the aggregation name (just as the online help
suggests), then the correct aggregation is being queried, but the service
description contains <tt>HOSTNAME</tt> instead of the actual host name. So
the expansion of <tt>$HOSTNAME</tt> in the service description does not work.
