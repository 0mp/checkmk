Title: Missing contact group check-mk-notify when never been in WATO
Component: core

1. Create a new site in the CEE
2. omd config set CORE nagios
3. cmk -R --> missing contact group check-mk-notify

When you now go in WATO (no need for changing something), it works
out. Seems that the default WATO configuration fixes that.
