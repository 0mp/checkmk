Title: notify.py: subprocess p.communicate() calls may block when plugins output a lot
Component: notifcation

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

MK: Problem unclear. Is it a problem that a short blocking might occur? Then
that is not the fault of communicate() but of the fact that the execution
of the script may take time.
