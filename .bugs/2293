Title: datasource and service discovery check
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2015-01-30 09:10:34
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

When selecting a different datasource for a host (a shell script), the
service discovery check for the host complains about a missing snmp_info
and snmp_uptime service, even thought the host is not configured to use snmp
(but check_mk_agent with a different datasource).  Version is 1.2.6b7.

In the cache directory of the host, there are two files <hostname>.snmp_info
and <hostname>.snmp_uptime, They contain empty lists. Doing a tabula rasa
service discovery gives us the two additional services with empty check output.
