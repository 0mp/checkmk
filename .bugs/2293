Title: datasource and service discovery check
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2015-01-30 09:10:34
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

When selecting a different datasource for a host, the service discovery check
for the host complains about a missing snmp_info service, even thought the host
is not configured to use snmp (but check_mk_agent with a different datasource).
Version is 1.2.6b7. Doing a service discovery doesnt help.
