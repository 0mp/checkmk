Title: Login page shown (IE) while being logged in
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-01-16 13:06:47
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

Test on IE: We use cookie based login and are logged in.
Now we enter http://192.168.56.1/walks/ in the URL field
of IE and hit enter -> the login form is being show.
Now we can simply click "Login" without entering any data
and are logged in.

The login form should not be shown in the first place here!
