Title: WATO tags menue has issues when deleting tags
Component: wato
State: open

Class: bug

If you create an empty tag (desc. and tag id) and then another one the empty tag will 
corrupt the tag id's.
It seems this faulty state is also saved: 
If you delete another tag later on, all tags below the tag you're deleting are also lost.

It's already verified to be a bug ;)
