Title: WATO dashlets Service problems and Events of rec. 4 hours can die if view is missing
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-04-16 17:10:07
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: nastiness

The dashlets will print the following error
Internal error:: 'aggr_onlyproblems'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/omd/sites/new/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/index.py", line 312, in handler
    handler()
  File "/omd/sites/new/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/views.py", line 1047, in page_view
    show_view(view, True, True, True)
  File "/omd/sites/new/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/views.py", line 1163, in show_view
    vo = view_options(view["name"])
  File "/omd/sites/new/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/views.py", line 1564, in view_options
    del v[on]
KeyError: 'aggr_onlyproblems'

The error can be reproduced if you modify the following 
Multisite role setting to 'no':
Change column display options


Since this is user-modifyable we need to catch it and i.e. disable the dashlets.
