This will be an unloved request...

We will need an option to undo a change that has been "clicked" but is still
waiting for activation.  In a larger setup there could be 20 pending changes
because the admin(s) will try to match nagios downtimes for activation
or some other se. on the other hand right now you need to COMMIT a change
into the live configuration to UNDO it - even if you already noticed it was
erronoeous. (Ja, ich kann heute nicht tippen)

WONTFIX: This is impossible to implement. Changes are not stored as files
ore transactions but are direct modifications to the config files. Also
changes build are built on previous changes. The only possible thing is
to make a snapshot and get back to the snapshot later.
