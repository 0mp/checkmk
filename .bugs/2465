It's configured with the TextAttribute() object. Shouldn't we make it only accept ASCII characters
just like the TextASCII() valuespec? Or change these attributes to ValueSpecAttribute() and really
use TextAscii()?

We should not allow non ascii characters in these fields.

But there are umlaut domains. So: what do to?
