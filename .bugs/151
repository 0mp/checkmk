When doing a --snmpwalk if the target machine outputs multiline
HEX strings, the trailing spaces are stripped and thus hex codes
are glued together (202E instead of 20 2E). That way, the hex
string detection fails. This is probably in line 2731 of main.py:
the strip() should only strip trailing LF/CR, not spaces.
