Title: Windows inventory plugin seems to crash with cyrillic symbols in sofware list
Component: checks

Targetversion: 1.2.7
Class: bug

With cyrillic symbols in the software list (manufacturer field) the inventory plugin crashs and doesn't report remaining sections.
The same probably applies to other symbols not present in the current code page.
