Title: PNP Popup does not work with HTTP-Login on different host

In a multi site setup where the remote hosts are not transparently
reachable via HTTP proxy but are directly connected by the browser,
the user has to enter his login again for each remote site. While
this is not nice, it works nevertheless. 

But: the PNP popups do *not* work, even after one is logged in.
