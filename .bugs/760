Title: View checkboxes: Request-URI Too Large
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-05-28 16:16:51
Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: bug

If you select too many checkboxes in a Multisite view
and execute a command, then you will get a
"Request-URI Too Large".

We need to convert the complete checkbox logic including
the page refresh to POST. This will then also fix bug
#759. Postponed until after 1.2.0.

Resolution: persist the current check state via AJAX
on a file on the server and do not try to transport
that information via GET/POST. Also consolidate Checkboxes
with WATO. WATO might need persistent checkboxes anyway.
