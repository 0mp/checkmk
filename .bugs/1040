/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job directory is created root.root 755 now
this way only cronjobs running under root can use mk-job

directory should be created with mode 1777 so cronjobs running under unprivileged
users can write their files into this directory too
this should be no security problem, because the t bit makes sure, every user can only
delete his own files
