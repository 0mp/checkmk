1.: I can assign either tag to my host(s) with out problem.     However, when I come back to the host later in WATO, the display will always show the first item (Production) even though some other tag is active. 
2.: Even worse,  if I were to save here without reselecting “Test”  it will set the host back to Production!   So, by just viewing and saving this host, like you might do to get to services, I set all the tags back to defaults
