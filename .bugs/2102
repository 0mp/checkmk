Title: Multisite python profiler can not handle POST data.
Component: multisite

Class: bug

Any POST data vanishs by the second run of the index.handler(apache._profiling_req) function
GET parameters of the same query are preserved.

Enabling the global option "Profile Requests" successfully shuts down most of the formulars
which are using the POST method. This also applies to the snapshot synchronisation.
