Title: It's not possible to edit a dashlet anymore
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2014-12-10 09:57:05
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

Clicking the edit button for a dashlet and saving the formular after leads to the following error:
Internal error:: local variable 'action' referenced before assignment (Retry with debug mode)

and then you get the following error when trying to open the view again:
     

Missing needed host parameter. ( Sorry the dasboard not view )
