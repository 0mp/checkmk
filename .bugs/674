Title: No login form in frame
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: nastiness

When the login dialog detects that it is running in a frame
and not as the main page (or the frame's name is "main" or "side"),
then it should redirect to index.py and remove the frame set.
This can be done by Javascript.
