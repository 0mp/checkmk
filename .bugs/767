Title: Remove all downtimes does not work
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-06-08 16:02:53
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

The button "Remove all downtimes" in the host/services
commands dialog is not yet implemented. One can remove 
downtimes in the downtimes table - but nicer would be
to do it here - or remove the button.
