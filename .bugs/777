Title: Role-Editor Permission view: WATO chapter duplicate
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2012-06-21 10:49:06
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

In the role editor the section with the WATO permissions
is displayed twice.

LM: This does only happen when one defines a permission
for a section, e.g. wato.*, which has already been followed
by another section.
I have a fix for this but this is too big for a fix release.
