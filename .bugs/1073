Title: Chrome: help switches on randomly
Component: multisite

The online help sometimes randomly switches on on Chrome on Windows.
Never seen this on Firefox. Seems like the help.mk in the user profile
correctly corresponds to the settings, so there it is no javascript problem?

This seems hard to reproduce. We can use Chrome for a while...
