This is an incompatible change. Make sure that the old variable is
still defined for some time. Also look for further checks using
that variable or doing an utilization check (windows) and bring
these checks together (maybe with an include)?

In order to make migration easier, we could catch configurations
still using the old variable, automatically set the new, and 
output a Warning.

Then write a README in doc/ that describes how to rename
configuration variables (for us developers).
