Title: mkeventd init script does not handle stale pidfiles correctly
Component: ec

Targetversion: 1.2.2
Class: bug

When running etc/init.d/mkeventd stop when having a pidfile but no running
process, the "kill $THE_PID" call results in an error message which should
be supressed. Instead it should show "OK" and delete the stale pidfile.

The status command also has this error message which should be suppressed.

Restart is completely broken in this case.
