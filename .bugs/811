Title: Multisite does not display local check man pages
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-11-16 10:39:32
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

If you install an MKP and it brings a check man page this man page is not 
displayed from Multisite, instead it gives an error about not finding the
check man page in the default path. It would be good if multisite could
also check the local/ structure for existing man pages
