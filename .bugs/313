The ntpq -p call will do one reverse lookup per NTP clock.
This is slowing down check_mk_agent by a moment for systems 
with few clocks and fast DNS servers, or not slowing down at all when 
just using files as hosts source.
BUT if there is any rDNS issue (think windows admins doing the DNS) or if theres
notable latency to the DNS servers (i.e. when using "pool pool.ntp.org") then this 
will slow down the agent run by many seconds.

We should discuss switching to ntpq -n -p to disable hostname lookups.
