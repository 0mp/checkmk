Title: Reschedule Checks only affects some services from the list
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

Reschedule active checks like HW/SW Inventory doesn't work at all. If you
have for example 50 Services, only 12 where done.  So you have to do it
multiple times until all checks are triggered.

mk: Maybe this could be the known problem that the CMC ignores all
but the first command if more commands are sent via Livestatus
in one write().
