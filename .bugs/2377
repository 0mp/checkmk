When you edit the Context/Search Filters section of a report, dashboard or
view then for each context type (e.g. services) there is a dropdown where
you can add filters. Added filters are then greyed out in the dropdown. This
is OK.

But: If you enter the dialog and there are already filters then these are not
contained in the dropdown - not even grayed out. When you now delete such
a filter you cannot re-add it without saving and coming back.

Fix: Add the already present filters greyed out to the initial drop down.
