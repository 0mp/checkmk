Title: Cleanup OMD manpage paths

The regular check manpage path in OMD is share/doc/check_mk/checks but the
local path is local/share/check_mk/checkman. This is confusing. Cleanup the
normal/local paths to make them equal.

Resolution: Change the OMD path to share/check_mk/checkman. Move the
directory around. No symlinking. Manpages are not intended for manual
reading.
