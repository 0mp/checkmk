The perfdata icon is missing on PING checks created for ping only hosts. The
check creates perfdata but the detections seems to fail.

The problem is that the PING service in check_mk_templates.cfg does not use
the template 'check_mk_perf'. The use line should look like this:

  use check_mk_perf,check_mk_default

Plus the process_perfdata 0 line need to be removed.

In fact the data is gathered in the host check but the missing link seems
to confuse the users since the check generates performance data.
