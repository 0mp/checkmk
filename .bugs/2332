Title: Add button in host details for creating a manual check for this host

Due to the movement of the manual checks into a new WATO module it is
not longer possible to create a manual check right from the host details.
We could add a button [Manual Checks] here, that bringst you to the
WATO module for manual checks - while keeping the host context. Wehn
you select a rule set you would then see the green balls and have a but
for creating a rule for that specific host.
