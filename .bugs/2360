Title: "Fake check results" on hosts doesn't work
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.7

The "Fake check results" feature on hosts allows to set the status of the host to "up", "down" or "unreachable" but this has no effect, the host status stays as it was.

Works for me. Could be be cause of Smart PING that updates the
state *really* fast.
