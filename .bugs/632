Title: No Multisite-permission but login
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-02-14 16:24:10
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

If you have no role and thus no permission to use Multisite, then
you can login anyways (via Cookie-based login or other). But
then there is just an error message but no way to log out again.
This is especially bad with Cookie based login since closing
the browser does not help.

Solution:

1. Do not allow to save a user without any roles
2. (in addition): Add a logout link to the error
message.
