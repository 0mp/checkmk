Logfile that grow fast make problems with mk_logwatch since
the processing takes too long. We could make the following
solution:

in logwatch.cfg one can add paramters to logfiles, e.g.
/var/log/*  ; maxlines=20000

That way processing would parse at most 20000 new lines in the
file and *add an artificial error message* with state "C"
or "W" if this limit is exceeded.

Exceeding lines are not lost but processed in the next
turn.
