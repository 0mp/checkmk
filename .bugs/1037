Host = Windows 7
CMK Agent = Agent version 1.2.2p1

I have found a problem where the check_mk_agent.exe is unable to restart after a crash because the logstate.txt file becomes currupt.

Attached is an example currupt logstate.txt file.

To work around the problem I remove the logstate.txt and then start the check_mk_agent.exe successfully.


hint by bs: the attached logstate.txt is 0 bytes
