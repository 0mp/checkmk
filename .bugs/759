Title: Checkbox handling in views sometimes broken
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-05-28 16:13:51
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

The handling of the checkboxes in the views still has
bad control flows. The following will trigger a bug:

1. Open a view where the checkboxes are currently off
2. Turn on the checkboxes
3. Check one of the checkboxes
4. Open the command tab and select a command
5. Do *not* confirm the command but press "No"

Now try to turn *off* the checkboxes. This is not
working!

Furthermore: If you now uncheck the one single
checkbox and again issue a command: it will still
think this box is checked.
