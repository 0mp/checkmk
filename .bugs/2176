Title: logwatch: files with timestamps, initial text missing
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

If logwatch detects a new logfile it starts at the end of this file.
If a logfile is generated daily with a new timestamp the initial lines
are skipped and error messages might get lost.
