Title: Link for Column in view editor shows duplicate views

When selecting the View to link to in the view editor then
the mobile views are very irritating. 

We could show those only if the current view is a mobile
view. Or better: Prefix all mobile views with "Mobile: "
and put those at the bottom of the ist.

Also Only show view that have at least on "hide"-Filter.
Views without a context are not useful for linking.
