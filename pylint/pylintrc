#   Disable this because we often use multiple types for a single variable. Maybe we
#   can change this in future to make such linter checks work, but for the moment these
#   checks are useless with Check_MK.
# unpacking-non-sequence

[TYPECHECK]
# rrdtool
#   Can not check methods / attributes of the rrdtool C module. Skipping related errors
#   like the following:
#   [E1101(no-member), create_rrd] Module 'rrdtool' has no 'create' member
# ldap
#   The Python ldap module gets a lot of constants from the C API which can not be found by pylint.
#   This results in a lot of these errors: "Module 'ldap' has no 'OPT_REFERRALS' member".
